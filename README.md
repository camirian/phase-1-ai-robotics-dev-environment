# Phase 1: AI Robotics Professional Development Environment

This repository documents the complete setup and configuration of a professional-grade development environment for advanced robotics and AI applications. The goal is to establish a robust, reproducible, and distributed system consisting of a powerful host development workstation and a physical edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson).

This setup serves as the foundational environment for all subsequent projects in my AI Robotics Portfolio.

## üöÄ Key Components

1.  **Host Development Workstation:** A powerful PC running Ubuntu 22.04, equipped with an NVIDIA RTX GPU for high-fidelity simulation and AI model training.
2.  **Edge AI Device:** An NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for developing and testing "sim-to-real" deployments, running perception and control algorithms on physical hardware.
