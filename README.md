# Phase 1: AI Robotics Professional Development Environment

This repository documents the complete setup and configuration of a professional-grade development environment for advanced robotics and AI applications. The goal is to establish a robust, reproducible, and distributed system consisting of a powerful host development workstation and a physical edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson).

This setup serves as the foundational environment for all subsequent projects in my AI Robotics Portfolio.

## ‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated

Successfully completing this foundational setup demonstrates core competencies in:

-   **Systems Administration:** Proficiently installing and configuring a Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) environment from scratch, including disk partitioning for dual-boot systems.
-   **Hardware & Driver Management:** Correctly installing and verifying proprietary NVIDIA drivers on Linux, including handling dependencies and Secure Boot (MOK) enrollment.
-   **Distributed Systems & Networking:** Establishing and verifying a multi-machine ROS 2 network, proving an understanding of distributed computing and the DDS discovery mechanism.
-   **Embedded & Edge AI Systems:** Flashing and configuring an embedded device (NVIDIA Jetson) with the JetPack SDK, preparing it for sim-to-real deployment.
-   **Version Control & Professional Documentation:** Utilizing Git and GitHub for version control and maintaining high-quality, structured documentation for a technical project.
