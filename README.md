# Phase 1: AI Robotics Professional Development Environment

This repository documents the complete setup and configuration of a professional-grade development environment for advanced robotics and AI applications. The goal is to establish a robust, reproducible, and distributed system consisting of a powerful host development workstation and a physical edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson).

This setup serves as the foundational environment for all subsequent projects in my AI Robotics Portfolio. For definitions of key terms, please see my central **[AI & Robotics Glossary](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/phase-0-robotics-glossary/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md)**.

## ‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated

Successfully completing this foundational setup demonstrates core competencies in:

-   **Systems Administration:** Proficiently installing and configuring a Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) environment from scratch, including disk partitioning for dual-boot systems.
-   **Hardware & Driver Management:** Correctly installing and verifying proprietary NVIDIA drivers on Linux, including handling dependencies and Secure Boot (MOK) enrollment.
-   **Distributed Systems & Networking:** Establishing and verifying a multi-machine ROS 2 network, proving an understanding of the DDS discovery mechanism.
-   **Embedded & Edge AI Systems:** Flashing and configuring an embedded device (NVIDIA Jetson) with the JetPack SDK, preparing it for sim-to-real deployment.
-   **Version Control & Professional Documentation:** Utilizing Git and GitHub for version control and maintaining high-quality, structured documentation for a technical project.
